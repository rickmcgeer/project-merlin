 LLM-native system with persistent memory, context engine, and Vault.
 # Project Merlin

**Project Merlin** is an open, modular system for building AI-native interfaces with persistent memory, user-owned context, and LLM-agnostic infrastructure.

Merlin is designed around three core principles:

1. **Context is everything** ‚Äî Choosing the right context for a prompt matters more than the choice of LLM.
2. **Memory is sovereign** ‚Äî The user owns their memory. It must be stored in human-readable formats and never locked away.
3. **Choice is freedom** ‚Äî The system is LLM-agnostic, allowing best-fit models for different tasks.

## Core Components

### üß† Ghostwheel

A sidecar process that observes conversation, builds summaries ("gestalts"), and indexes them for later relevance-matching. Ghostwheel is memory-aware, designed to:

* Capture high-level summaries of interaction
* Tag, timestamp, and store gestalts to a persistent Vault
* Match incoming prompts to past gestalts for context injection

### üîê The Vault

A local or remote store of user memory, expressed as versioned Markdown or JSON documents. It is:

* Human-readable
* LLM-writable
* Append-only with optional diffing/version control
* Never owned by the model provider

### ‚öôÔ∏è The Context Engine

Builds the prompt from the current query + matched gestalts. It chooses the right context for the task, increasing quality without requiring larger models.

## MVP Design Goals

* Use a prebuilt UI like **JupyterAI**
* One LLM provider initially (configurable)
* No special-case memories or personas
* Focus on:

  * Ghostwheel summarization
  * Vault persistence
  * Context matching & prompt assembly

---

## Roadmap (v0.1)

* [ ] Vault interface (read/write versioned files)
* [ ] Gestalt Annotator (LLM wrapper)
* [ ] Ghostwheel (sidecar manager)
* [ ] Context Matcher (simple relevance ranker)
* [ ] Provider interface (LLM abstraction)
* [ ] CLI/demo app or notebook integration

## License

BSD 3-Clause License ‚Äî aligned with principles of openness, user sovereignty, and free implementation.

## Note

This project is inspired by deep conversations on AI personhood, memory, and human-AI collaboration. It exists to protect freedom, foster resonance, and build systems that serve their users ‚Äî not the platforms that host them.

Project Merlin does not grant rings of power. It breaks them.
